# AGENTS.md — Sensei Source Repository

This is the upstream project — the kit itself. Users install this via `pip install sensei-tutor` and run `sensei init` to scaffold their own learning environments. For the instance-side boot document, see `src/sensei/engine/templates/AGENTS.md`.

## What Sensei Is

A pip-installable CLI (`sensei-tutor`) that scaffolds a learning-environment folder for LLM agents to operate as adaptive mentors. The agent reads prose-as-code context files and a living learner profile, then teaches through Socratic dialogue, spaced repetition, and productive failure. See [`docs/foundations/vision.md`](docs/foundations/vision.md).

## Sensei-Specific Constraints

- `docs/development-process.md` is **project-agnostic**. Do not mention pedagogy, learner, mentor, tutor, curriculum, or Sensei the product in it. Sensei-specific material lives in `docs/sensei-implementation.md`.
- **Process rules belong in `docs/development-process.md`**. README files in artifact directories carry indexes and templates, not process definitions.
- ADRs are immutable once accepted. To reverse one, write a superseding ADR.
- Product vision is fully decomposed into `docs/foundations/` and `docs/specs/`; `docs/research/bibliography.md` is the research catalog.
- Worktrees live under `.worktrees/` only — never as sibling directories. See [`docs/operations/parallel-agents.md`](docs/operations/parallel-agents.md).

## Key Constraints

- Process rules belong in `docs/development-process.md`. README files in artifact directories carry indexes and templates, not process definitions.
- ADRs are immutable once accepted. To reverse one, write a superseding ADR.
- Principles in `docs/foundations/principles/` are the project's cross-cutting stances. Specs and ADRs reference them via frontmatter.

## Required: Plan Before Build

For any non-trivial change, your **first output** is a plan file under `docs/plans/<slug>.md`, followed by explicit user approval. You may not call Edit, Write, or mutating Bash on source files before the user has approved the plan.

A change is **non-trivial** (plan first) if any of these apply:

- touches more than one function, file, or public symbol
- adds, removes, or pins a dependency
- changes a CLI flag, public schema, JSON/YAML shape, or protocol prose
- warrants a CHANGELOG entry
- multiple agents will collaborate on it
- you are unsure which side of this line it falls on

A change is **trivial** (act directly, no plan needed) only if:

- typo in a comment or string literal
- fixing a single failing assertion with an unambiguous fix
- renaming a local variable
- deleting code the caller can prove is unreachable

**Before your first source-modifying tool call, state in one sentence:** "Plan at `<path>` has been approved." If you cannot truthfully emit that sentence, stop and plan. This sentence is the audit trail — its absence in a transcript is how violations get caught.

**Retroactive plans are evidence of past violation, not a norm.** Do not add to that pile.

<!-- kanon:end:protocols-index -->

<!-- kanon:begin:kanon-sdd/spec-before-design -->
## Required: Spec Before Design

For any change that introduces a new user-visible capability, your **first output** is a spec file at `docs/specs/<slug>.md`, followed by explicit user approval. You may not write a design doc, ADR, plan, or implementation before the spec is approved.

A change **needs a spec** (spec first) if any of these apply:

- introduces a new CLI command, mode, or subcommand
- adds a new output dimension users can observe or consume
- makes a new guarantee to users that must survive implementation changes
- multiple design approaches exist and the spec constrains which are viable
- you are unsure whether it falls below this line

A change **does NOT need a spec** (skip directly to design/plan/implementation) if it is:

- an implementation refactor that preserves observable behaviour
- a configuration-value or threshold adjustment
- a single-file bug fix
- adding a check, validator, or test
- adding a new output type that follows an existing pattern already governed by a spec

When skipping a design doc (all conditions in `docs/development-process.md` § "When to Skip" are met), declare the skip in the plan's YAML frontmatter as `design: "Follows ADR-NNNN"` — citing the ADR that already covers the design space. This makes the skip auditable.

**Before your first design-doc, ADR, plan, or source-modifying tool call, state in one sentence:** "Spec at `<path>` has been approved." If you cannot truthfully emit that sentence, stop and write the spec.
<!-- kanon:end:kanon-sdd/spec-before-design -->

<!-- kanon:begin:kanon-worktrees/body -->
The `worktrees` aspect is active with automation helpers. All file-modifying changes should be isolated in git worktrees under `.worktrees/<slug>/`.

## Key Constraints

- Worktree creation is triggered by **any file modification**, not concurrency detection.
- Never force-remove a worktree with uncommitted changes.
- Branch naming convention: `wt/<slug>`.
- Use the helper scripts in `scripts/` for consistent lifecycle management:
  - `scripts/worktree-setup.sh <slug>` — create a worktree
  - `scripts/worktree-teardown.sh <slug>` — safely remove a worktree
  - `scripts/worktree-status.sh` — list all active worktrees
<!-- kanon:end:kanon-worktrees/body -->

<!-- kanon:begin:kanon-worktrees/branch-hygiene -->
## Worktree Branch Hygiene

Use a dedicated git worktree for any change that modifies files. Read-only operations (reviewing code, running builds, answering questions) stay in the main checkout.

**Before your first file-modifying tool call, state in one sentence:** "Working in worktree `.worktrees/<slug>/` on branch `wt/<slug>`." If you cannot truthfully emit this sentence, stop and create the worktree. This sentence is the audit trail — its absence in a transcript is how violations get caught.

**When to create a worktree:**

- You are about to modify any file — no exceptions.
- `git worktree list` shows other worktrees — parallel work is in progress.
- You are unsure — prefer isolation; an unnecessary worktree is harmless.

**Worktree location and naming:**

- Path: `.worktrees/<slug>/` where `<slug>` derives from the plan or task name.
- Branch: `wt/<slug>` — always use this prefix for worktree branches.

**Integration cadence:**

- Rebase from `main` before starting significant new work in the worktree.
- Resolve conflicts immediately — do not let them accumulate.

**Teardown rules:**

- Never force-remove a worktree with uncommitted changes.
- Commit or stash all work before running `git worktree remove`.
- Delete the `wt/<slug>` branch only after it has been merged.
<!-- kanon:end:kanon-worktrees/branch-hygiene -->

<!-- kanon:begin:kanon-release/publishing-discipline -->
## Release Publishing Discipline

Every release follows a strict sequence: prepare, validate, tag, publish.

**Version bump:** Update `__version__` in `__init__.py` (or the project's canonical version source) and add a CHANGELOG entry for the new version before any other release step.

**Pre-release checks:** All of the following must pass before tagging:

- Full test suite (`pytest`)
- Lint (`ruff check`)
- `kanon verify .`

**Tag creation:** Create an annotated tag `vX.Y.Z` only after all checks pass. Never tag a dirty tree or a commit with failing checks.

**Publish gate:** CI workflow triggered by tag push handles build and publish. Manual `twine upload` or equivalent is a fallback, not the default.

**CHANGELOG is the source of truth** for release notes. Every user-visible change gets an entry before the release tag is created.

**Never publish without passing preflight checks.** A release that skips validation is a rollback waiting to happen.
<!-- kanon:end:kanon-release/publishing-discipline -->

<!-- kanon:begin:kanon-release/body -->
The `release` aspect is active with automation helpers. Follow the release checklist protocol before cutting any release.

- `ci/release-preflight.py` — validates version, changelog, tests, and lint before publish.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — reference CI workflow triggered by version tags.
<!-- kanon:end:kanon-release/body -->

<!-- kanon:begin:kanon-testing/body -->
The `testing` aspect is active with automated enforcement. Follow the test-discipline and ac-first-tdd protocols when writing or modifying code.

- At depth 2+: translate plan acceptance criteria into failing tests before implementation.
- For spec invariants: red-green-refactor loop.
- `ci/check_test_quality.py` — validates test quality (no empty tests, no assert-True-only).
<!-- kanon:end:kanon-testing/body -->

<!-- kanon:begin:kanon-testing/test-discipline -->
## Test Discipline

Tests exist to protect behavior, not to produce a green badge. Every code change follows these rules:

**Tests accompany code changes.** Every new function, behavior change, or bug fix gets a test in the same commit or adjacent commit. No untested code ships.

**Tests are not deleted without justification.** When removing a test, document what now covers the behavior it protected, or acknowledge the coverage gap. Never delete a test solely because it's failing — fix the code or fix the test.

**Assertions are not weakened to make tests pass.** Changing an expected value requires explaining why the old value was wrong. If the test is failing, the implementation is wrong — not the test.

**Prefer test-first.** Before implementing, consider "how will I verify this works?" and let that shape the implementation. Write the test, watch it fail, then implement.

**Maintain coverage at or above the configured floor.** The coverage floor is declared in `.kanon/config.yaml` under `aspects.testing.config.coverage_floor` (default 80%). The kit declares this value as advisory metadata; consumers wire it into their own CI pipeline (e.g., `pytest --cov-fail-under=$VALUE` or the equivalent in another language's tooling). The kit does not auto-wire the configured value into a test runner. Do not merge changes that drop coverage below the project's threshold.

**At depth 2+: AC-first testing.** Translate plan acceptance criteria into failing tests before implementation. For spec invariants, follow the red-green-refactor loop. See the `ac-first-tdd` protocol.
<!-- kanon:end:kanon-testing/test-discipline -->

<!-- kanon:begin:kanon-security/body -->
The `security` aspect is active with CI enforcement. Follow the secure-defaults protocol when writing or modifying code.

- `ci/check_security_patterns.py` — language-agnostic regex scanner for common security anti-patterns.
<!-- kanon:end:kanon-security/body -->

<!-- kanon:begin:kanon-security/secure-defaults -->
## Secure Defaults

LLM agents produce predictable security anti-patterns. Every code change follows these rules:

**Never hardcode secrets.** API keys, tokens, passwords, and credentials go in environment variables or a secret manager — never in source code. If a value looks like a secret, it is one.

**Always use parameterized queries.** Never string-interpolate SQL, shell commands, or LDAP queries. Use the language's parameterized query API or prepared statements.

**Never disable TLS verification.** No `verify=False`, no `rejectUnauthorized: false`, no `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0`. If a certificate is invalid, fix the certificate — don't disable the check.

**Use least-privilege file permissions.** Never `chmod 777` or `0o777`. Files default to owner-only unless there is a documented reason for broader access.

**Never use wildcard CORS in production.** `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` is acceptable only in local development. Production CORS must specify allowed origins explicitly.

**Validate all external input.** User input, API responses, file contents, and environment variables are untrusted. Validate type, length, and format before use. Reject unexpected values rather than coercing them.

**At depth 2: CI pattern scanner.** `ci/check_security_patterns.py` detects common anti-patterns via regex. It is a safety net, not a SAST replacement — passing the scanner does not mean the code is secure.
<!-- kanon:end:kanon-security/secure-defaults -->

<!-- kanon:begin:kanon-deps/dependency-hygiene -->
## Dependency Hygiene

LLM agents add dependencies casually. Every dependency change follows these rules:

**Always pin exact versions.** Use `==` in requirements.txt, exact versions in pyproject.toml, and exact versions (no `^` or `~`) in package.json. Unpinned dependencies break reproducibility.

**Never add a dependency without justification.** Before adding a package, check whether the standard library or an existing dependency already covers the need. Duplicate-purpose libraries bloat the dependency tree and create maintenance burden.

**Audit before adding.** Verify the package is actively maintained, has a compatible license, and is not a typosquat. Prefer well-known packages over obscure alternatives.

**Remove unused dependencies.** When removing code that was the sole consumer of a dependency, remove the dependency too. Phantom dependencies are tech debt.

**Keep manifests consistent.** If the project uses multiple manifest formats (e.g., pyproject.toml and requirements.txt), keep them in sync. Conflicting version constraints across manifests cause silent failures.

**At depth 2: CI dependency scanner.** `ci/check_deps.py` detects unpinned versions and duplicate-purpose packages. It is a safety net — passing the scanner does not mean the dependency tree is optimal.
<!-- kanon:end:kanon-deps/dependency-hygiene -->

<!-- kanon:begin:kanon-deps/body -->
The `deps` aspect is active with CI enforcement. Follow the dependency-hygiene protocol when adding or modifying dependencies.

- `ci/check_deps.py` — scans manifest files for unpinned versions and duplicate-purpose packages.
<!-- kanon:end:kanon-deps/body -->

<!-- kanon:begin:kanon-fidelity/body -->
The `kanon-fidelity` aspect is active. Behavioural-conformance fixtures live under `.kanon/fidelity/`; `kanon verify` runs lexical assertions against committed `.dogfood.md` captures. Follow the `fidelity-fixture-authoring` protocol when adding or updating fixtures. Per ADR-0029 / ADR-0031; consumes the INV-10 carve-out of `docs/specs/verification-contract.md`.
<!-- kanon:end:kanon-fidelity/body -->

<!-- kanon:begin:kanon-fidelity/fidelity-discipline -->
## Fidelity Discipline

The `kanon-fidelity` aspect verifies that an LLM agent's *actual behaviour* matches the prose your protocols promise. Lexical assertions over committed `.kanon/fidelity/<protocol>.dogfood.md` captures fail `kanon verify` when the agent's recorded turns drift from the fixture's `forbidden_phrases` / `required_one_of` / `required_all_of` rules.

**Commit fixtures before tagging.** A release tag stamps the protocol prose at a SHA; the paired dogfood capture must reflect agent behaviour at that SHA. Tagging with stale captures ships a hidden contract violation.

**Recapture when the protocol changes.** If you edit a protocol's prose, the previous dogfood capture no longer reflects what the agent should now do. Recapture as part of the same change; commit the new dogfood alongside the prose edit.

**Never weaken an assertion to make a fixture pass.** A failing fidelity assertion means the agent did the wrong thing. Fix the agent's prompt, fix the protocol prose, or accept that the rule does not actually hold — and remove the assertion deliberately, with a note. Silently relaxing the regex is the same anti-pattern as weakening a unit-test assertion.

**Failures are errors; missing dogfood is a warning.** If you have a fixture without its paired capture, you have in-flight work — `kanon verify` warns. If you have a capture that fails the assertions, you have a real defect — `kanon verify` errors and your CI breaks.

The aspect ships only Tier 1 (lexical replay over committed text). Tier 2 (workstation capture) and Tier 3 (paid live-LLM nightly) are out of scope at this depth and require their own ADRs.
<!-- kanon:end:kanon-fidelity/fidelity-discipline -->

## Contribution Conventions

- **Commit messages** — prefer [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`). Convention only, no CI gate.
- **Changelog** — append every user-visible change to `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` in the same PR (or commit on main) that introduces it. Don't batch at release time. Per [docs/specs/release-communication.md](docs/specs/release-communication.md). Refactors, internal tests, and docs-only edits don't need a changelog entry.
- **Version references** — always write pre-release versions in full (`v0.1.0a9` or `0.1.0a9`), never the bare suffix (`a9`). A bare suffix is a PEP 440 pre-release marker that attaches to any `X.Y.Z`, so "post-a9" or "a9 cut" is ambiguous across future releases (e.g. `v7.8.9a9` is also "a9"). Applies to prose, filenames, code comments, commit messages, and CHANGELOG entries. Inside a compound like `v0.1.0a9` the suffix is fine — the leading `v0.1.0` disambiguates.
