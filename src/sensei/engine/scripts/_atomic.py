    Algorithm:
    1. Write to a sibling .tmp file (same directory → same filesystem).
    2. fsync the file descriptor so bytes reach storage before rename.
    3. os.replace() for an atomic POSIX rename(2); also safe on Windows.
    4. fsync the parent directory so the rename's dirent update is durable
       across power loss. Required on POSIX — the file fsync covers data
       but not the containing directory entry. No-op on non-POSIX.
    5. On any exception, remove the tmp file to avoid leaving debris.
